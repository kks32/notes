# The Anatomy of Story
> John Truby

* The author creates a puzzle in two major ways: by telling the audience certain information and by *witholding* certain information. Witholding forces the audience to figure out, when the audience no longer has to figure out, the story stops.

* Whenever a character learns a new information, they make a decision and change their course of action.

* Any character who goes after a desire is impeded and is forced to struggle (otherwise the story stops). The goal is to present a change in character or illustrate why that change did not occur.

* Nature users a few basic patterns and variations to connect different elements together, from linear, meandering, spiral to explosive. Linear story tracks a single main character from beginning to end. Explosive has everything happening simultaneously. Meandering and spiral are some combination of linear and explosive patterns. A spiral pattern is one in which a character keeps returning to a single event or memory and explores it at progressively deeper levels. Stories that are explosive need to show how different elements fit or not fit together.
