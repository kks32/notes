* Information is interpreted more easily and more uniformly if it is placed where most readers expect to find it.

## Structure of scientific writing

**Provide context for your reader before asking that reader to consider anything new.**

1. Place the person or thing whose "story" a sentence is telling at the beginning of the sentence, in the topic position.
2. The new, emphasis-worthy information appears in the stress position.
3. Place appropriate "old information" (material already stated in the discourse) in the topic position for linkage backward and contextualization forward.


### Grammatical style

1. Follow a grammatical subject as soon as possible with its verb.
2. Articulate the action of every clause or sentence in its verb.
