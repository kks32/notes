* Information is interpreted more easily and more uniformly if it is placed where most readers expect to find it.

## Structure of scientific writing

**Provide context for your reader before asking that reader to consider anything new.**

1. Place the person or thing whose "story" a sentence is telling at the beginning of the sentence, in the topic position.
2. The new, emphasis-worthy information appears in the stress position.
3. Place appropriate "old information" (material already stated in the discourse) in the topic position for linkage backward and contextualization forward.


### Grammatical style

1. Follow a grammatical subject as soon as possible with its verb.
2. Articulate the action of every clause or sentence in its verb.


## Writing grant applications

[Put important thing in the first sentence](https://seliger.com/2017/08/21/grant-writing-help-series-put-important-thing-first-sentence/)

"**Put the most important thing in the first sentence.**" If you learn how to do this, you’ll be ahead of 80% of grant writers and would-be grant writers. Most proposals prepared by other “grant writers” fail the first-sentence test.

A compelling proposal, even a highly technical one, needs to make an argument about why funding the proposal will lead to improvement innovations, breakthroughs, or improvements.

Answering the why:
* Why you are targeting what you are targeting?
* Why you have decided on what you will do?
* Why you will provide services in a particular area?
