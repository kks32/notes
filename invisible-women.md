* It's been widely accepted that the evolution of humans and the central role Hunter-gatherer ideology played. Caroline argues if all are evolutionary products of successful adaption of hunting, what does that mean for women's humanity?

* Renisannace and enlightenment age still did not allow women to read. How is it an enlightenment age, when 50% of the population was in the dark ages?

* In Vienna, 60% of all journeys are by foot. Vienna considers gender planning in transportation seriously. Women and men tend to use transportation systems differently. Women apparently tend to do more trip chaining when performing unpaid caregiving duties, which women tend to do a lot more than men. By considering the needs of the Women, Vienna made it more friendly for pedestrians. Wider pavements and more accessible footpaths promoted better pedestrian-friendly routes. The city is actively looking and making decisions based on women's travel needs. 

* Sweden decided to look at all their policies with a view of gender balance. After a male minister sarcastically commented that at least we don't have to look at snow-clearing of roads, Sweden looked into the problem of clearing snows. Men tend to use roads more than women. Women have to drop kids, do other unpaid care work, which involves a lot of walking on the pavements, so deicing the sidewalks is more important than clearing the roads. Surprising, it also reduced the number of injuries, because fewer people were slipping on ice and falling and injuring themselves. 

* London has a radial network of the transportation system, which are designed for men to get to work and home. London now adopts a 1-hour travel pass, so women can make more hop-on-hop-off trips to tend to their higher unpaid caregiving duties. Barcelona changed to a grid system from a radial system of the road network.
